  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was so happy to attend this Work Week, first because I was invited by the QA Team and I was so excited to meet them in person and learn more from them during the course of the Work Week.</p>

<p>The work week started on 22th June evening until the evening of the 27th. It was a <em>busy</em> week, and during the course of the week I met a lot of nice people and discovered a lot of things about other projects in Mozilla. I also had some time to discover the charming Village where the event was held.</p>

<p>At first, all of us attended the All hands sessions, because in this kind of conference all the Mozilla&rsquo;s executives talk about the good and weak point in some projects, and about the Mozilla Future, such as:</p>

<p>The participation Team, a newly formed team in Mozilla worked hard to take care of each person in the community, and they rocked in the stage too:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/comzeradd/status/614112419686645760" title="Permalink to Nikos Roussos on Twitter: &quot;#mozwww &quot;Mozillians live beside our users. They are our eyes into every market in the world&quot; http://t.co/3FoozAqtEQ&quot;">I liked very much this part :</a> # Nikos Roussos on Twitter: &ldquo;#mozwww "Mozillians live beside our users. They are our eyes into every market in the world&rdquo; <a href="http://t.co/3FoozAqtEQ">http://t.co/3FoozAqtEQ</a>"</p>

<p>At this Work Week I participated in two sessions about QA and two sessions about l10n.</p>

<p>In the First QA session, Naoki gave a session on Worldwide QA and Peter B. gave an   Overall Review on QA Test. It was an interesting session for me discovering how the team works on the project working with to make a good tests.  I also heard about the Automation at this time from Johan. But I was a little bit disappointed at first, since all the participants in the room were employees and I was the only contributor so I didn&rsquo;t easily understand what they are talking about and they didn&rsquo;t look interested in the contributor., When they talked about contributors during this time I can talk and discuss with them, but it was only in few minutes. On the last day Johan explained to me a lot of things regarding the project, and I was able to better understand the scope of what they do and became much more interested in writing some automated tests.</p>

<p>The Second QA Session was with the participation Team, QA and Reps. It was a really short session - we hoped to get more time. We discussed our problems - from the contributor perspective and in the community, and we tried to grab a Problem statement from these problems &ldquo; How Might we &hellip; get 5% of the Reps doing QA know how to do better QA and train this to others&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was great to discuss this statement, we hoped that we were more than 5 in this session and the others came to tell us more there problems and discuss this point with us</p>

<p>Our solution was to make a program like training the trainer at first identify the Reps doing QA and this trainer will run event to get more contributor on QA.</p>

<p>While in the work week I joined the l10n team for session of RTL &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; to discuss the last version released with Arabic Language and there we got the surprise from Ahmed &lsquo;The RTL guy&rsquo; - he did the 2.0 version of Firefox OS and fixed all bugs related to RTL. It was an amazing surprise, and the other session was to discuss the Arabic translation of the mozilla.org project and the fact that we need more contributors and people able to commit to SVN.</p>

<p>In the end, I am so happy that I met the QA team in person and had the chance to talk and discuss with them, and It was a Great second work week for me. \o/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I enjoyed my day with this amazing version of Firefox OS Spark. First let me tell you about it - it’s a customization and features built on top of the next generation of the Firefox OS platform and is a subset of the Ignite initiative. Spark is intended to empower users to truly customize their experience, hack whatever they want to, and make their devices truly their own. For more information, I invite you to read this <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/Spark">link</a> .</p>

<p>Next, I will talk about my experience:</p>

<blockquote><p>How to flash it on the Flame</p>

<p>The adventure of discovering</p></blockquote>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Start with the Flash</h2>

<p>If you have the last version (3.0) of Firefox OS it’s okay, If you are running the 2.0 or 2.2 Version you should switch to the latest version because they aren’t using the same Base image. So to flash your flame you will need to Download <a href="cds.w5v8t3u9.hwcdn.net/v18D_nightly_v2.zip">the nightly Base Image</a> before updating your phone. After the download, you just need to extract the file, put your phone in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Phone_guide/Flame/Updating_your_Flame#Fastboot_mode">fastboot mode</a> and finally open your Terminal and run the flash.sh script <code>./flash.sh</code> .</p>

<p>Now, to update your phone to the 3.0 Version, all you need is to download the gaia and b2g image from <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-flame-kk-eng/">here</a> and the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mozilla-TWQA/B2G-flash-tool/master/shallow_flash.sh">shallow script</a></p>

<p>and after that run this command in your terminal:</p>

<p><code>sudo ./shallow_flash.sh -g/home/mermi/../gaia.zip -G/home/mermi/../b2g-41.0a1.en-US.android-arm.tar.gz</code> .</p>

<p>The last thing to do to get the <strong>spark Version</strong> is to run this command in your Terminal under the gaia repository:</p>

<p><code>sudo GAIA_DISTRIBUTION_DIR=distros/spark make reset-gaia</code></p>

<h5>And you will get the famous spark like me :D</h5>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/29dXTGw.png?1" alt="SparkVersionFxOS" /></p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Discover the New Things</h2>

<p>First you need to enable the Developer Mode</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qMJjm2C.png?1" alt="enableDevMode" /></p>

<p>When you open any one of this App ( Customizer, Hackerplace, Studio,..) you should follow the instructions appeared</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2xc0C49.png?1" alt="inst1" /></p>

<hr />

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iW2l5lv.png?1" alt="inst2" /></p>

<p><strong><em> And after the Last Enable </em></strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UjE902h.png?1" alt="instn" /></p>

<blockquote><p>your phone will restart to switch to the developer Mode</p></blockquote>

<h3>Customizer Application:</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Vbgu8CZ.png?1" alt="customizer" /></p>

<p>** You will find all the available Application in your phone</p>

<h3>Hackerplace Application</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nWRA3Pl.png?1" alt="Hackerplace" /></p>

<p><strong>* Here we find Apps and Add-Ons, with just one Addon </strong><a href="https://github.com/mikehenrty/fxos-cracked">Cracked</a>**</p>

<p>and a Lot of other Applications like <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>WhatsApp</strong>, <strong>Notes</strong>, <strong>Bugzilla Lite</strong>, <strong>Webmaker</strong>, <strong>BuddyUp</strong></p>

<p>I really appreciate this version and I think it can be better and will be appreciated by all the people using Firefox OS. Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is supposed to post my Blog post before 1 months, But when you are studying in engineering class you can&rsquo;t find free time to write.
In this Post I am telling you about my experience in a Mozilla Work Week:</p>

<p>Me and Ahmed Nefzaoui, were invited to participate to this amazing work week, It was a huge opportunity for us to ,  At first we  were stressed  about getting our USA Visa, and then when we got it, the adventure travelling to USA and meet the most important people of Mozilla started.</p>

<p>It was from 1st December to 6th, which was gathering the different teams and people from different functional areas working for the Mozilla project, to plan for the future of Mozilla, specifically for the next year but also have a lot of FUN.
I was invited by the CBT (Community Building Team), because of the kind of my contribution, I was also around Localization, Webmaker and Firefox OS teams, I presented in many sessions in which discussed about Mozilla Events in 2015 and about the regional community propose solutions to the current problems. Amazing experience it was.
I&rsquo;m very proud to be there and meet all those awesome people I always knew through IRC, Twitter and Facebook. I had a chance to meet Pascal Chevrel  and talked  with him about Arabic Localization and I had the chance to get guidance from him on how to work on the l10n of mozilla.org.</p>

<p>I met also the Firefox OS UX Team led by Stephany Wilkes to discuss Design Patterns in Firefox OS Right-To-Left (RTL) User interface I was very happy to meet them and I spoke spontaneously to them, just because I felt like with my family.
I was very proud and glad to finally meet the lovely french women that I knew through IRC and Twitter and the first person to guide me in Womoz &ldquo;Dephine&rdquo;.
&ldquo; I&rsquo;m very glad to meet you delphine, I spent amazing moments with you in #mozlandia &rdquo;
I had the opportunity to meet and know new Mozillians, Thanks for all the people that made my travel and this experience happen  with a lot of Fun.
Really Thanks to Marcia, Delphine, Ioana, Ankit, Pascal, Alexandre :D I hope to meet you all very soon!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Mozilla Festival happened in London, It was an awesome Festival, it gathered passionate technology makers and creators eager to share their skills and many of them coming from different countries.</p>

<h2>Mozilla Festival 2014</h2>

<p>I was invited to this festival as a Festival facilitator with the other reps, firstly I want to thanks Mozilla and all the Reps for this opportunity.</p>

<p>I arrived on 23th October at 4:20pm exactly and it was too difficult to get to the Hotel. When I arrived to the Mozilla Office, I began with introducing my self and my contributions as a Rep. So the meeting was about the schedule of our participation to Mozilla Festival and we shared some gifts from our countries and some goodies. It was a funny first day with Reps.</p>

<p>The First Day of Mozilla Festival was on 24th October. We met all the other volunteers of the Mozilla Festival and we planned for our sessions. First in this day I worked with Deb (is an amazing reps from India), we worked on <a href="" title="http://mermi.github.io/MozFest/#/">Mozilla Reps presentation slides</a> for the science fair booth. I am very glad to work with you, deb</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1fiOYDgXa9U/VEu6kLnVhUI/AAAAAAAACmg/palWVEA8KB8/s1600/IMG_20141024_200227205.jpg" title="" alt="work in group" /></p>

<p>And I presented the Popcorn Maker with Ankit (who is also another reps from India and Webmaker Mentor), it was really amazing all the people coming andasking us about the tools: how does it work? how how can I use it ? and for what I will need it and sometimes we talked about the Webmaker Project.</p></p>

<p>On 25th October was the first Big day, I joined the keynote in the morning and after that I have joined the session of Mozilla Student Ambassador Recruitment it was a funny session. Also I had a talk with the Hive Community and they asked me if I want to make a local community in Tunisia and it was grateful opportunity for me so we shared our contact after a long talk and I am so motivated to make local hive community in Tunisia.

<p>The last day of Mozilla Festival was the most tiring and amazing day, I came too early to the Venue with other Reps to get our Flame and I spent all the day flashing the flame given to the attendees and explain more how to use it and how to Flash it for the people who asked for the engineering build.</p>

<p>It was a very exhausting and crazy experience for me. I really had fun, know a lot of things and discovered a lot of things. Also I have met the craziest and most beautiful people in this world :D</p>
